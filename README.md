# this is a python notebook that implement neuron simulation tools for (HH, Leaky, ML, FN, GLeaky, D1 models).
in this notebook you can see the UI implementation for HH, Leaky, ML, FN, GLeaky, D1 model.
you can change the parameters of models by slide bars and also you can give 3 diffrent input to theese model (Pulse, Ramp, Constant). you can change the shape of input signals by changing the parameters for each input parameters and see the respond of neuron model to that kind of input.
the UI also shows the input signal and plot of dV/dt with respect to the v_m
